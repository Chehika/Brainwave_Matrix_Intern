## Overview

This repository includes two beginner-friendly data analytics tasks that demonstrate the power of Python in deriving insights from real-world data:

Task 1: Sales analysis of a chocolate store, focusing on revenue, product performance, and global trends.

Task 2: Sentiment analysis of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# Task 1: Sales Analysis
Description
This project analyzes transactional sales data from a commercial chocolate store to understand business performance. It includes data cleaning, summary metrics, and insightful visualizations.

## Tools Utilized
Python: Core programming language

pandas: Data loading, cleaning, and analysis

matplotlib: Visualizing trends and comparisons

## Key Steps
Data Cleaning: Converted date fields and cleaned currency values.

Total Revenue & Units Sold: Calculated key financial and operational metrics.

Top 5 Products: Identified and visualized the highest-selling chocolates.

Country-Wise Sales: Mapped out international performance.

Monthly Trends: Charted revenue trends over time.

## Outcome
This analysis offers a snapshot of product popularity, seasonal performance, and geographical trends—essential for decision-making in retail.

# Task 2: Sentiment Analysis
Description
This task classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative using machine learning. It demonstrates basic natural language processing using the TF-IDF approach and Logistic Regression.

## Tools Utilized
Python: Core programming language

pandas: Data handling

scikit-learn: Train-test splitting, TF-IDF vectorization, model building, evaluation

matplotlib: Pie chart visualization

## Key Steps
Text Preprocessing: Loaded and labeled sentiment data (positive = 1, negative = 0).

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converted text to numerical features.

Model Training: Used Logistic Regression for classification.

Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using a classification report.

Visualization: Displayed predicted sentiment distribution using a pie chart.

## Outcome
This task provides a foundational example of applying machine learning to unstructured data and understanding public sentiment based on text.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python can be effectively used for real-world data analytics across both structured and unstructured datasets. It offers hands-on experience with data cleaning, feature extraction, model building, and visualization—making it a practical learning resource for students or beginners aiming to enter the field of data science and analytics.
